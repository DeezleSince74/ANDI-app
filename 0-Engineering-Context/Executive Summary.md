**Executive Summary**  
**Company:** ANDI Labs  
**Product:** ANDI (AI Instructional Coach)  
**Industry:** Education Technology (EdTech)

ANDI Labs is building the future of instructional coaching through artificial intelligence. Our flagship product, ANDI, is an AI-powered platform that listens to real-time classroom activity, analyzes teaching using research-backed frameworks, and delivers personalized, actionable feedback to teachers. This transforms how educators grow professionally—making effective coaching scalable, affordable, and accessible to all.

The current coaching system is broken: only 25% of teachers receive regular feedback, and most coaching is inconsistent or inaccessible due to cost and time constraints. Meanwhile, over 65% of students lack essential problem-solving skills, and teachers report feeling unsupported. ANDI addresses these systemic challenges head-on, leveraging patent-pending technology—including automated classroom audio analysis, AI-driven recommendations, and a proprietary Classroom Impact Quotient (CIQ) framework—to improve teaching outcomes at a fraction of the traditional cost.

Founded by Dr. Jocelyn Logan-Friend and Derek Frempong—leaders in education reform and AI innovation—ANDI Labs is targeting the $140B global EdTech market, starting with 1.9 million U.S. middle and high school teachers. Our go-to-market strategy includes pilot programs in high-need districts, a freemium model to drive grassroots adoption, and partnerships with schools, districts, and EdTech platforms.

TEDCO funding will support further development of our IP, expansion of pilot programs in Maryland, and early-stage customer acquisition—laying the foundation for national scale and long-term economic impact.

ANDI: Your favorite teacher’s favorite teacher.
