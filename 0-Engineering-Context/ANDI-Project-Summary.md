# ANDI Project Summary

## Executive Overview

ANDI (Artificial Intelligence Instructional Coach) is an AI-powered educational platform designed to revolutionize teaching through automated classroom analysis and personalized coaching. Built by ANDI Labs, the platform serves as "Your favorite teacher's favorite teacher," transforming classroom audio data into actionable insights that help educators improve their teaching practices.

## The Problem We're Solving

The current state of educational coaching is broken:
- Only 25% of teachers receive regular feedback on their teaching
- Over 65% of students lack essential problem-solving skills needed for success
- Most teachers report feeling unsupported due to inconsistent or inaccessible coaching
- Significant educational inequity persists based on race, ethnicity, and social class
- Traditional coaching is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale

## Our Solution: AI-Powered Instructional Coaching

ANDI provides a comprehensive platform that:
1. **Captures** classroom audio using multi-directional microphones
2. **Analyzes** teaching effectiveness through AI-powered transcription and natural language processing
3. **Measures** engagement using our proprietary Classroom Impact Quotient (CIQ)
4. **Generates** personalized, research-backed recommendations for improvement
5. **Tracks** progress over time and celebrates growth

## The CIQ Framework: Our Core Innovation

The Classroom Impact Quotient (CIQ) is ANDI's proprietary metric that quantifies classroom engagement through three pillars:

### 1. Equity
- **Roll Call**: Identifying who's in the room
- **Safety First**: Ensuring psychological safety
- **Everything for Everyone**: Guaranteeing access
- **Can You Hear Me Now**: Elevating all voices
- **Teamwork**: Leveraging shared thinking

### 2. Creativity
- **Express Yourself**: Encouraging self-expression
- **Play, Get Messy**: Promoting experimentation
- **Learn by Doing**: Developing skills actively
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Continuous improvement
- **Imagination Ignited**: Fostering bold thinking

### 3. Innovation
- **Hope**: Inspiring possibility
- **Making Tangible Connections**: Real-world links
- **Change-Making**: Sharing innovations
- **Level-up**: Measuring impact
- **Revise and Reset**: Continuous adaptation

## How It Works

### Data Collection & Integration
- **50%** - SIS/LMS Integration: Academic data, behavioral metrics, attendance, participation
- **20%** - Survey Data: Teacher and student experience feedback
- **30%** - ECI Blueprint: Equity, Creativity, and Innovation indicators

### Processing Pipeline
1. Audio capture through browser-based recording
2. Speech-to-text conversion via Assembly AI
3. NLP analysis to extract meaningful insights
4. Parallel analyzers assess:
   - Question types and patterns
   - Teacher vs. student talk time
   - Engagement markers
   - CIQ metrics
5. AI generates personalized recommendations
6. Results presented through intuitive dashboards

### Unique Approach
- **Non-evaluative**: Focuses on growth and reflection, not judgment
- **Visual Learning Landscape**: Uses organic shapes and colors instead of scores
- **Adaptive**: Personalizes insights based on teacher profile, goals, and context
- **Continuous Learning**: System improves with each interaction
