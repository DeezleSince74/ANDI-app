5. We don’t over-engineer our solutions.  
6. We ensure that our features and functionality are accessible and usable.  
7. Usability is measured using [Heuristic Analysis](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/), time studies, success rates, error rates, and user feedback or opinion.  
8. We always document relevant product information with brevity, thoroughness, and thoughtfulness.
