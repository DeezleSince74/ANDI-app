**Classroom Impact Quotient (CIQ): Framework and Operational Overview**

---

### **Overview**

The Classroom Impact Quotient (CIQ) is an advanced, AI-powered metric designed to quantify and enhance the overall quality of engagement and interaction within K‚Äì12 classroom environments.  

CIQ is not an evaluative tool \- it is a reflective and developmental system designed to identify what‚Äôs working in the classroom and promote those practices. Its purpose is to illuminate strengths, surface opportunities for growth, and empower educators with actionable insights that enhance learning. CIQ celebrates progress, supports experimentation, and helps build more adaptive, responsive, and impactful learning environments. 

***CIQ is not just a metric‚Äîit is a movement towards smarter, more responsive, and human-centered education.***

### **Why CIQ is Important**

1. **Instructional Coaching**: Equips educators with actionable insights via the AI Instructional Coach for targeted professional development.  
2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provides school leaders with evidence-based tools to improve curriculum design, classroom management, and resource allocation.  
3. **Behavioral Impact Analysis**: Highlights how student and teacher behaviors contribute to or hinder learning.  
4. **Inclusivity and Equity**: Promotes equity by identifying gaps in psychological safety, access, and self-expression.

### **Default Data Inputs (Engagement Markers)**

The CIQ score is calculated using a diverse set of data inputs referred to as Classroom Engagement Markers. CIQ leverages multiple data inputs, including audio data from classroom interactions, to measure behaviors that positively or negatively influence student learning, teacher performance, and classroom dynamics. The weighting indicated below is the initial weighting for each classroom prior to any data collection.

### **Engagement Markers**

#### **1\. SIS/LMS Integration (50%)**

#### **Academic Data (15%)**

* Daily presence and punctuality  
* Trends over time

#### **Participation Metrics (20%)**

* Level of Student Questioning (Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy)  
* Level of Teacher Assignments/Questioning (Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy)  
* Teacher vs. Student Talk Time

#### **2\. Survey Data (20%)**

#### **Teacher Experience (10%)**

* Confidence in instructional delivery  
* Job satisfaction and stress levels  
* Perception of student engagement

#### **Student Experience (10%)**

* Perceived learning effectiveness

#### **3\. ECI Blueprint for Learning (30%)**

####  **Equity (10%)**

* Psychological safety  
* Self-awareness development  
* Access to resources and opportunity

#### **Creativity (10%)**

* Opportunities for self-expression  
* Freedom to explore, experiment, and make mistakes  
* Development of critical thinking

#### **Innovation (10%)**

* Problem-solving opportunities  
* Real-world application of knowledge  
* Student-driven impact projects

### **Adaptive Weighting Model**

### The Adaptive Weighting Model is a core component of the CIQ, designed to ensure that the score is not static but evolves with the real-time needs of educators and students. Rather than applying a universal standard, the model adapts dynamically based on four key elements: the teacher's professional profile, their instructional goals, the classroom context, and real-time data collected through the CIQ system \- including audio analysis and other engagement markers.

### By aligning the weight of each input (e.g., participation, equity, innovation) with what matters most in a given instructional setting, CIQ produces highly relevant, personalized insights that directly support teaching and learning.

### **How the Model Personalizes Weights**

1. ### **Teacher Profile and Needs**    The model considers teacher experience, instructional style, and self-identified areas for growth to emphasize inputs that best support their development.

2. ### **Teacher Goals**    Teachers can set short- or long-term goals (e.g., improving student voice, fostering critical thinking), which the system uses to prioritize relevant CIQ dimensions in the scoring.

3. ### **Classroom Context**    Class size, grade level, subject, and student demographics are factored in, allowing the algorithm to reflect the complexity and nuances of each teaching environment.

4. ### **CIQ Engagement Markers**    Real-time classroom data \- such as talk-time distribution, questioning depth (Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy), emotional tone, and interaction patterns \- are continuously analyzed to fine-tune input weights and suggest targeted supports.

### **CIQ Score Display: Insightful, Human-Centered, and Empowering**

The CIQ score is visualized as a **dynamic, color-coded ecosystem** rather than a numerical grade or ranking. This design intentionally avoids comparison or evaluation, and instead focuses on **growth, patterns, and actionable insights**.

#### **üå± Visual Representation: The Learning Landscape**

* The classroom‚Äôs CIQ score appears as a **‚ÄúLearning Landscape‚Äù**‚Äîa stylized, evolving visual made up of **five key zones**:

* **Engagement**  
* **Equity**  
* **Creativity**  
* **Innovation**  
* **Well-being**

* Each zone is represented by an **organic shape** (e.g., branches, waves, or growth rings) that **grows, shifts color, or pulses** based on classroom trends and positive behaviors.

#### **üîç Highlights Over Scores**

* Rather than showing a score, the interface displays **‚ÄúHighlights‚Äù**, such as:

  * *‚ÄúStrong student voice detected during group activities‚Äù*

  * *‚ÄúIncrease in critical thinking questions from students‚Äù*

  * *‚ÄúEmotional tone in classroom improved week-over-week‚Äù*

#### **üîÅ Progress Over Time**

* A **timeline view** shows how each domain evolves‚Äîemphasizing **momentum and direction** rather than fixed status.

* Teachers can see what strategies or conditions contributed to improvements, reinforcing agency and growth.

#### **üí° Strength Signals**

* Visual ‚Äúglows‚Äù or ‚Äúbadges‚Äù appear in areas where sustained strengths are detected.

* Teachers receive **AI-generated affirmations** like:

  * *‚ÄúYour use of open-ended questions is elevating student thinking.‚Äù*

  * *‚ÄúStudents are consistently engaging with real-world problems.‚Äù*

#### **üîÑ Personal Goal Alignment**

* Educators can set focus areas (e.g., ‚Äúincrease participation‚Äù), and the landscape **animates progress in those zones**, aligning directly with their intentions‚Äînot someone else's metrics.

**Why We Love It**

* AI-Enhanced Coaching: Personalized, real-time insights based on actual classroom interactions.  
* Non-Evaluative Focus: Prioritizing growth, agency, and self-reflection rather than compliance or judgment.  
* Student-Centered Metrics: Captures nuanced behaviors like risk-taking, self-expression, and psychological safety, rarely quantified in traditional assessment models.  
* Customizable Visualization: Replacing reductive scores with dynamic visuals aligned to teacher-set goals is a progressive and empowering idea.
