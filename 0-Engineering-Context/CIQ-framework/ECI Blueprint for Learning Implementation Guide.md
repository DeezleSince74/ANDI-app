# Letter from Logan & Friends CEO

**Dear Educators, Parents, and Change-Makers,**

I‚Äôm beyond excited to introduce you to the ECI Framework for Learning‚Äîa game-changing approach designed to make learning more meaningful, engaging, and, most importantly, fun\! As the founder and CEO of Logan & Friends, my mission has always been to create learning environments that inspire and empower every student. And that‚Äôs exactly why I built this blueprint.

A little about me‚ÄîI‚Äôm Dr. Jocelyn Logan-Friend, an educator and lifelong champion for students and teachers alike. I‚Äôve spent years studying how kids learn, what helps them thrive, and how we can break down the barriers that hold them back. From classrooms to boardrooms, I‚Äôve worked with schools, communities, and policymakers to create better learning experiences. But I kept coming back to one big question: **How do we make learning truly impactful, exciting, and relevant for today‚Äôs students?**

The answer? The **ECI Framework**‚Äîbuilt on three core principles:

‚ú® **Equity** ‚Äì Every child deserves the right tools, support, and opportunities to succeed. Learning should be accessible, fair, and designed for all.

üé® **Creativity** ‚Äì When students get the chance to explore, create, and express themselves, learning becomes an adventure rather than a chore.

üöÄ **Innovation** ‚Äì The world is changing fast\! We need to equip students with the critical thinking, adaptability, and problem-solving skills they‚Äôll need to succeed in the future.

But here‚Äôs the best part‚Äîthe ECI Framework isn‚Äôt just another theory. It‚Äôs a movement\! It‚Äôs about reimagining education in a way that actually makes sense for real students and real classrooms. I believe we can build learning experiences that spark curiosity, boost confidence, and prepare kids for a future full of possibilities.

So, dive into this guide, explore the strategies, and let‚Äôs bring the **joy** back into learning together. Whether you‚Äôre a teacher, parent, or community leader, you have the power to shape the future of education. Let‚Äôs make it one where every child thrives.

**With excitement and gratitude,**

**Dr. Jocelyn Logan-Friend**  
Founder & CEO, Logan & Friends

This evidence-backed approach lays out a clear, hands-on roadmap for teachers, caregivers, and community leaders, offering smart strategies that work everywhere‚Äîfrom buzzing classrooms to cozy home setups and lively community programs. With a focus on fresh, student-centered techniques, the ECI Framework not only ramps up academic skills but also sparks personal growth, ensuring every learner gets a chance to shine.

## Magic Ingredients {#magic-ingredients}

* **Equity:** Imagine a classroom where every student feels like a superstar. Equity means providing all learners with the resources they need to succeed while creating a safe space where everyone feels valued, heard, and respected. This strong foundation boosts self-awareness and confidence, paving the way for deeper engagement and long-term success.  
* **Creativity:** Think of creativity as the spark that lights up curiosity and fuels exploration. By inviting students to express themselves in new ways, creativity turns learning into an adventure. When educators weave creative thinking into lessons, students are inspired to take risks, tackle problems in innovative ways, and fall in love with learning.  
* **Innovation:** In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, innovation is the key to staying ahead. It nurtures critical thinking and adaptability, preparing students to thrive amid change. By embracing cutting-edge technologies and fresh, cross-disciplinary teaching methods, the ECI Framework equips learners with the skills they need for academic excellence and exciting future careers.

### **More Than Just Buzzwords** {#more-than-just-buzzwords}

These aren‚Äôt just fancy ideas‚Äîthey‚Äôre powerful forces that transform how students learn and grow. When Equity, Creativity, and Innovation become part of daily practice, they shape richer educational experiences, build social-emotional strength, and lay down the tools for lifelong achievement. Students learn to take charge of their education and build meaningful, fulfilling lives.

## Who Should Use This Guide? {#who-should-use-this-guide?}

This guide is designed for everyone passionate about transforming learning into a vibrant, dynamic experience. Whether you're a teacher eager to energize your classroom, a caregiver seeking to support a child‚Äôs growth at home, or a community leader committed to sparking positive change, the ECI Framework is here for you. It‚Äôs perfect for administrators and policymakers who want to build more inclusive and innovative educational environments, too. No matter your role, if you believe that every learner deserves a safe space to express themselves, explore boldly, and innovate fearlessly, then this guide is your go-to resource for making a real difference.

* **Research-Based Foundations** \- Each component of the guide is grounded in research. For instance, the E1 Roll Call: Who is in the room? section draws on studies that emphasize the importance of recognizing diverse identities in creating equitable learning spaces (Agirdag & De Leersnyder, 2024; March & Gaffney, 2010). By reviewing the research summaries provided, you can understand the "why" behind each practice, ensuring that your approach is both evidence-based and tailored to address real challenges in education.  
* **Strategies to Try** \- Throughout the guide, you‚Äôll find detailed strategies designed to help you put theory into practice. For example, under E1a Understanding of Identities, the guide suggests an Identity Integration Plan. This strategy provides step-by-step instructions‚Äîsuch as using surveys at the start of the year and scheduling quarterly identity check-ins‚Äîto systematically integrate students‚Äô cultural backgrounds into your curriculum. These strategies are designed to be adaptable, so you can modify them to best fit your classroom or learning environment.  
* **Prompts to Try** \- Prompts are included to spark meaningful discussions and encourage students to share their experiences. In the section on authentic identity, you might encounter a prompt like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs something about your culture or family traditions that you think we could all learn from or find cool?‚Äù These prompts are carefully crafted to facilitate reflection and conversation, helping students articulate their personal narratives and strengthening their sense of belonging. They serve as conversation starters that deepen the connection between students and the curriculum.  
* **Activities to Try** \- The guide also offers engaging, hands-on activities that bring the concepts to life. For example, the Cultural Showcase Gallery activity invites students to contribute artifacts from their cultural heritage‚Äîsuch as photos, recipes, or stories‚Äîto create a classroom display. This activity not only celebrates diversity but also reinforces the research that shows active participation boosts academic confidence and engagement (Alvi & Gillies, 2021). These activities are designed to be interactive, fun, and effective in promoting inclusivity and creative expression.

# The Research {#the-research}

The ECI Blueprint for Learning is like a treasure map that blends insights from psychology, neuroscience, and education to reveal how we learn, remember, and grow. Research shows that our intellectual, emotional, and social development is shaped not only by what we learn but also by where and how we learn it. In fact, nearly 70% of students report feeling disconnected when their classrooms lack supportive environments (Edmonson, 2018). Trailblazers like John Dewey and Paulo Freire have taught us that learning comes alive when it‚Äôs hands-on, reflective, and tied to real-life experiences. By combining Dewey‚Äôs ‚Äúlearn by doing‚Äù spirit with Freire‚Äôs passion for social justice, educators can spark vibrant, transformative learning spaces that drive both personal growth and collective change.

## Equity {#equity}

Why equity? Education is the cornerstone of individual and societal progress, yet shocking disparities still persist in classrooms around the globe. Equity isn‚Äôt just about handing out equal resources‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating safe spaces where every student can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Consider that over 40% of public schools in the U.S. still grapple with resource gaps that hinder learning (Horsford et al., 2018; Darling-Hammond, 2015). The ECI Framework tackles equity head-on by focusing on three pillars: psychological safety, access, and authentic identity.

**Equity is Psychological Safety**

Imagine stepping into a classroom where you can share your wildest ideas without fear‚Äîstudies reveal that classrooms with high psychological safety boost student engagement by up to 30% (Edmonson, 2018). When students feel secure and empowered to take risks, they naturally experiment, tackle challenges, and collaborate with enthusiasm (Han et al., 2022; Sadegh et al., 2024).

**Equity is Access**

Picture a classroom as a vibrant community feast where everyone gets their fair share. Yet, startling statistics show that nearly 50% of students in underfunded schools lack access to up-to-date materials and experienced educators (Horsford et al., 2018; DeMatthews, 2015). By dismantling these barriers and ensuring every student enjoys high-quality educational resources, we can transform learning into a rich, culturally resonant experience.

**Equity is Authentic Identity**

Our unique backgrounds are our superpowers. When classrooms celebrate authentic identities, students not only feel seen and valued, but studies indicate that academic confidence can surge by as much as 25% (Oemig & Baptiste, 2018). By integrating community-based knowledge and honoring cultural capital, educators can build a true sense of belonging.

## Creativity {#creativity}

Why creativity? It‚Äôs the secret sauce that spices up academic success. Creative classrooms don‚Äôt just enhance problem-solving and critical thinking‚Äîthey offer students the chance to express themselves fully. Research suggests that environments nurturing creativity can improve problem-solving skills by up to 30% (Amabile, 1996). When students are encouraged to take creative risks, they uncover unique perspectives, build resilience, and learn to see mistakes as stepping stones toward breakthrough ideas. Early models, like Graham Wallas‚Äô stages of creativity‚Äîpreparation, incubation, illumination, and even an added intimation stage (Sadler-Smith, 2015)‚Äîremind us that creativity is a dynamic journey shaped by both our past experiences and cultural influences.

## Innovation {#innovation}

Innovation is the vibrant engine that transforms creative energy into real-world solutions. Endogenous innovation theory tells us that fresh ideas emerge from within vibrant, interconnected communities. Schumpeter argued that innovation isn‚Äôt about isolated genius‚Äîit‚Äôs about a whole system reacting to unexpected moments (Antonelli, 2017). In fact, 65% of educators agree that fostering innovation through project-based learning and technology integration is essential for preparing students for tomorrow‚Äôs challenges. When students see their ideas take flight‚Äîsupported by continuous feedback from peers, teachers, and the broader community‚Äîthey learn to own their learning journey and solve complex problems with confidence.

**Conclusion: Uniting Equity, Creativity, and Innovation**

The journey of the ECI Blueprint for Learning begins with equity‚Äîa solid foundation where every student feels safe, has equal access, and can express their authentic self (Edmonson, 2018; Horsford et al., 2018; Oemig & Baptiste, 2018). When equity is in place, creativity can truly take root, turning classrooms into dynamic spaces where ideas flourish and students gain up to 30% more confidence in problem-solving (Amabile, 1996; Sadler-Smith, 2015

# The Blueprint Breakdown {#the-blueprint-breakdown}

At a high level, the blueprint weaves together three essential pillars‚ÄîEquity, Creativity, and Innovation‚Äîto form a comprehensive framework for transformative learning. The Equity component lays the groundwork by ensuring that every student's presence, safety, access to resources, and unique voice is recognized and valued. From initiating a roll call that honors diverse perspectives (E1) to fostering a collaborative spirit through shared teamwork (E5), this pillar establishes an inclusive environment where learners can truly belong.

Building on this solid foundation, the Creativity dimension is designed to unlock and nurture self-expression and exploratory learning. It begins with encouraging personal expression (C6) and playful experimentation (C7), then moves to hands-on skill development (C8), continuous refinement (C9), and ultimately igniting bold, imaginative thinking (C10). This sequence empowers students to discover and develop their creative potential, making learning an engaging and dynamic journey.

Finally, the Innovation pillar propels this creative energy into actionable outcomes. It starts by inspiring a mindset of possibility (I11) and creating meaningful connections to real-world contexts (I12), then shifts focus to generating transformative change (I13) and assessing impact (I14). It concludes with a commitment to continuous improvement (I15), ensuring that the innovative process remains dynamic and responsive.

Together, these components form a synergistic framework where equitable conditions enable creativity to thrive, and creativity, in turn, sparks innovative solutions‚Äîempowering students to create, problem solve, and build the lives they aspire to lead.

| EQUITY | CREATIVITY | INNOVATION |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **E1 Roll Call: Who is in the room?**  *Identify who is present, recognizing the variety of experiences and perspectives in the group.*   | **C6 Express Yourself**: How will we nurture self-expression? *Create an environment where students can explore their personal creativity.* | **I11 Hope: Inspiring Possibility** How will we inspire a mindset of possibility?  *Cultivate an environment that encourages optimism and open-mindedness.*  |

## E1 Roll Call: Who is in the room? {#e1-roll-call:-who-is-in-the-room?}

**Identify who is present, recognizing the variety of experiences and perspectives in the group.**

Recognizing the variety of experiences and perspectives in the classroom is vital for creating an equitable and supportive learning environment. It allows educators to respond to the unique needs of every student.

| E1a | Understanding of Identities *Recognize the unique identities, backgrounds, cultures, and languages.* Acknowledge and appreciate the diverse personal histories and cultural contexts that individuals bring. |
| :---- | :---- |

Students come with their own unique blend of cultures, stories, and skills. By celebrating these identities, we can create a classroom where everyone feels seen and valued. The more we connect with our students‚Äô lived experiences, the more we build an environment that‚Äôs truly personalized and equitable.

Being a student is a child‚Äôs primary social identity. Therefore, it is critical to address the cultural capital of each student. Agirdag & Leersnyder (2024) stated that cultural capital refers to the diverse linguistic skills, familial and community-based knowledge systems, rich cultural narratives, and historical experiences students carry with them to school each day. Educators have the potential to influence the construction of students‚Äô identities and educational pathways by gaining awareness of students‚Äô unique life circumstances, perceptions, and aspirations (March & Gaffney, 2010). Learning through conversations allows students and teachers to develop understandings based on their respective life experiences (Alvi & Gillies, 2021), which supports identity awareness.

**What we Listen For**

Cultural Validation: Teachers acknowledging and incorporating students‚Äô cultural backgrounds in discussions and lessons. Example: ‚ÄúI know that some of you celebrate different holidays, and I‚Äôd love to hear about how your family celebrates them. Can anyone share how your traditions are similar or different from what we just discussed?‚Äù

Student Voice: Opportunities for students to share their unique experiences, languages, or cultural practices. Example: ‚ÄúDoes anyone speak another language at home? How does that language shape the way you see the world?‚Äù

Inclusive Language: Teachers and students using terms that celebrate diversity (e.g., names pronounced correctly, positive references to students‚Äô communities). Example: ‚ÄúI want to make sure I‚Äôm pronouncing your name correctly‚Äîplease let me know if I‚Äôm saying it wrong. Can you share a little about what your name means in your culture?‚Äù

**Strategy to Try**

Identity Integration Plan

Objective: Systematically incorporate students‚Äô cultural backgrounds into lesson plans and classroom activities.

How to implement:  
1\. Begin the year with a comprehensive survey for students to share their cultural practices, languages spoken at home, and personal interests.  
2\. Create opportunities in the curriculum where students‚Äô cultural narratives can enhance learning, such as inviting students to contribute examples or traditions during relevant topics.  
3\. Schedule quarterly ‚Äúidentity check-ins‚Äù where students reflect on how their identity informs their learning and contributions to the classroom.

Outcome: Builds a classroom culture where diverse identities are consistently recognized and valued as part of the learning process.

**Activity to Try**

Cultural Showcase Gallery

How it works: Students create a ‚Äúgallery‚Äù by contributing something meaningful from their culture, such as photos, a recipe, a piece of art, or a short written story. The items are displayed around the classroom, and students take turns ‚Äútouring‚Äù the gallery and asking each other questions.

Why it works: Encourages students to see the value in their own identities and learn from their peers, fostering a sense of pride and mutual respect.

**Prompt to Try**

* What‚Äôs something about your culture or family traditions that you think we could all learn from or find cool?  
* If someone were visiting your community for the first time, what would you want to show or tell them?

| E1b | Awareness of Marginalized Communities *Understand the presence of marginalized communities and the barriers they face.* Consider how systemic inequalities may impact full participation and belonging. |
| :---- | :---- |

The education system has some big inequities, but it‚Äôs time to shake things up\! To make classrooms fair for all, we need to challenge old ideas and break down the walls that hold some students back. When we level the playing field, every student gets the chance to thrive.

The disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes among students classified by differences in race, ethnicity, social class and other marginalizing factors suggest an educational system that is ‚Äúoppressive and unjust‚Äù (Furman, 2012, p. 194). It is essential that schools foster learning environments in which social, political, and cultural capital is enhanced in such a way that provides equitable opportunities to all students (Shields, 2010). We need to rethink our educational spaces to recognize sociohistorical processes that have led to racial disparities, detach from ideologies that promote smartness and goodness as the standard, and dismantle power and privilege hierarchies in education (Appleton et al., 2024).

**What We Listen For**

Equitable Participation: Are all students contributing, or are certain voices dominating the conversation? Example: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard from a few of you, but I‚Äôd love to hear from someone who hasn‚Äôt spoken yet. What do you think about this idea?‚Äù

Disparity Recognition: Discussions that critically explore social issues, systemic inequities, or historical contexts. Example: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think about how the history we‚Äôre studying affected different groups of people‚Äîwhat are the inequities that emerge in this time period, and how can we learn from them?‚Äù

Challenging Stereotypes: Teachers addressing and correcting biased or stereotypical remarks from students. Example: ‚ÄúI heard you say that certain groups are ‚Äòalways‚Äô like that. Let‚Äôs pause and think about where that stereotype comes from and how it might not be true for everyone.‚Äù

**Strategy to Try**

Equity Audit Framework

Objective: Regularly assess classroom content and interactions for inclusivity and equity.

How to implement:  
1\. Design an ‚Äúequity checklist‚Äù to review texts, visuals, and discussions for representation and inclusion.  
2\. Dedicate monthly sessions for students to engage in equity-focused analysis of historical events, current policies, or classroom dynamics.  
3\. Integrate reflection questions like, ‚ÄúAre there stories or perspectives we missed in this discussion? How can we include them?‚Äù

Outcome: Ensures an ongoing commitment to identifying and addressing systemic inequities within classroom practices.

**Activity to Try**

History Detective

How it works: Provide students with short stories, photos, or quotes from various marginalized communities. In small groups, they work as "detectives" to research and discuss the struggles and successes of these communities and present their findings creatively (e.g., posters or skits).

Why it works: Helps students engage with the realities of inequity in a way that builds empathy and critical thinking.

**Prompts to Try**

* Why do you think some people might have more challenges in school or life than others? What can we do to help?  
* Can you think of a time when something felt unfair? How did you handle it, and what would you have wanted others to do?

| E1c | Addressing Biases *Conscious and subconscious biases that may hinder participation.* Be mindful of implicit biases that can affect the inclusivity of the environment. |
| :---- | :---- |

Let‚Äôs ditch the idea that students from marginalized groups are ‚Äúbehind‚Äù because of something they lack. When we focus on systems, not stereotypes, we set the stage for all students to succeed. High expectations for everyone? Absolutely.

Wagstaff and Fusarelli (1995) claimed the single most important factor in the academic achievement of minoritized youth is the explicit rejection of deficit thinking. Deficit thinking places blame on students from historically oppressed populations for the challenges and inequities they face in school, while simultaneously ignoring systemic influences that create disparities in social and educational outcomes (Davis & Museus, 2019). These beliefs are rooted in negative stereotypes that lead educators to perceive that minoritized students have learning deficiencies as well as behavioral and emotional problems (Okilwa & Barnett, 2018). In Aridag & Leersnyder‚Äôs (2024) study, the researchers found that students who experience teacher discrimination are 5.7x less likely to achieve highly and 4.3x less likely to achieve excellently. Furthermore, Musto (2019) found that teachers provided less interaction, praise, and support to Black and Latinx students relative to White and Asian students. Therefore, growth mindsets are particularly important in diverse educational environments since it enables educators to foster resilience and high expectations.

**What We Listen For**

Growth Mindset Language: Teachers encouraging effort and progress rather than labeling students as "good" or "bad" at tasks. Example: ‚ÄúI can see you‚Äôre really working hard on this problem, and that effort is what will lead to success. Keep trying different strategies.‚Äù

Feedback Equality: Patterns showing whether teachers are equally praising and engaging with students across racial, cultural, and gender groups. Example: ‚ÄúI see great effort in your work, Jamal, and Maria‚Äîboth of you approached this problem with unique solutions. Let‚Äôs talk about how you reached your conclusions.‚Äù

Avoidance of Deficit Thinking: Teachers reframing challenges as opportunities for learning rather than shortcomings in students. Example: ‚ÄúThis is a tough problem, but I believe you‚Äôre capable of solving it with the right strategies. Let‚Äôs work through it together.‚Äù

**Strategy to Try**

Bias Reduction Cycle

Objective: Build awareness and challenge biases in a structured, repeatable process.

How to implement:  
1\. Introduce bi-weekly ‚ÄúBias Awareness Workshops‚Äù where students and educators collaboratively identify and deconstruct stereotypes through guided activities and discussions.  
2\. Use real-world scenarios to practice recognizing and responding to biased behavior.  
Include an anonymous reporting and reflection mechanism for students to safely express concerns about biases they encounter in the classroom.

Outcome: Promotes a proactive and reflective approach to addressing biases, cultivating a fair and supportive learning environment.

**Activity to Try**

The Assumption Game

How it works: Write statements or traits on index cards (e.g., ‚Äúlikes math,‚Äù ‚Äúgood at sports‚Äù) and distribute them randomly. Without revealing the card, students guess which trait their peers might associate with them and discuss why those assumptions exist.

Why it works: Helps students confront biases and stereotypes while encouraging self-awareness and perspective-taking.

**Prompts to Try**

* Have you ever felt misunderstood or judged by how you look, speak, or act? What did you wish people understood about you?  
* What‚Äôs a stereotype you‚Äôve heard about a group of people? Why do you think it‚Äôs not true or fair?

| E1d | Cultivating Empathy *Encourage empathy towards others in the room.* Promote understanding and compassion for the lived experiences and perspectives of others. |
| :---- | :---- |

Empathy is the secret sauce for a classroom where everyone feels like they belong. By putting ourselves in others‚Äô shoes, we create a space where collaboration thrives and problems get solved together. Plus, when students feel understood, they‚Äôre more engaged and ready to succeed.

Empathy plays an important role in supporting student learning by creating a positive, inclusive, and supportive classroom environment. Empathy is necessary in order to understand and be able to work with others to solve real-world problems (Montero, 2023). Recent studies have shown embedding empathy-based activities leads to positive results for increased student understanding and acceptance of others (Berggren et al., 2019; Hartman et al., 2017). Additionally, Montero (2023) asserted teaching 21st century skills through design thinking can help students learn to become more empathetic towards their peers and society (Montero, 2023). When educators and peers demonstrate empathy, it helps students feel valued and supported, which fosters greater engagement and academic success.

**What We Listen For**

Perspective-Taking: Students discussing how others might feel or experience situations differently. Example: ‚ÄúHow do you think your classmate from a different background might feel about this issue? Let‚Äôs try to see things from their point of view.‚Äù

Supportive Interactions: Verbal and non-verbal cues showing students helping and encouraging each other. Example: ‚ÄúI can see you‚Äôre having trouble with this, but don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm here to help. Let‚Äôs talk through it together,‚Äù followed by peer-to-peer collaboration.

Empathy-Driven Lessons: Teachers embedding activities or questions aimed at understanding others‚Äô experiences. Example: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs read this story from the perspective of someone who faces challenges we might not understand. What would it be like to walk in their shoes?‚Äù

**Strategy to Try** 

Empathy in Action Plan

Objective: Embed empathy-building activities into daily classroom routines to foster stronger connections.

How to implement:  
1\. Develop an ‚Äúempathy buddy‚Äù system where students partner with peers to share reflections, provide support, and learn about each other‚Äôs experiences weekly.  
2.Assign group projects that address real-world problems requiring collaborative and empathetic solutions, such as designing inclusive spaces or raising awareness about social issues.  
3\. Regularly practice perspective-taking exercises like role-playing or storytelling prompts that require students to imagine life from others‚Äô viewpoints.

Outcome: Creates a classroom where emotional intelligence and interpersonal understanding are consistently practiced and reinforced.

**Activity to Try**

Walk in Their Shoes

How it works: Create scenarios where students imagine themselves in someone else's position (e.g., a new student, a refugee, or a classmate struggling with a personal challenge). Groups brainstorm how they would feel, what they would need, and how others could help.

Why it works: Encourages students to practice empathy and think about real-world ways to support others.

**Prompts to Try**

* What‚Äôs one thing someone else in the room might be going through that we don‚Äôt know about? How could we support them?  
* Think about a time when someone made you feel really included or welcome. How can we do that for others here?

| E1e | Opportunities for Storytelling *Create opportunities for storytelling.* Provide spaces for participants to share their personal narratives and experiences in meaningful ways. |
| :---- | :---- |

Stories are powerful\! Giving students the chance to share their personal narratives helps them express themselves, build empathy, and connect with others. By lifting up diverse voices, we create a richer, more supportive classroom community where everyone‚Äôs story matters.

Sharing personal narratives fosters self-expression, builds empathy, and strengthens the classroom community. Additionally, reinforcing individual skills through opportunities to share stories and narratives, particularly for minority students, could enhance critical thinking abilities (Davies et al., 2023). Furthermore, the use of counternarratives, stories of the experiences of those who are marginalized and ‚Äúothered,‚Äù exposes and challenges stories of privilege (Bettez, 2017). By valuing personal narratives, educators create a supportive environment where students feel empowered to share their own stories.

**What We Listen For**

Personal Narratives: Students sharing their own stories or reflections during lessons. Example: ‚ÄúCan anyone share a time when they faced a challenge and how they overcame it? How did that experience shape the way you approach problems today?‚Äù

Counter-Narratives: Teachers incorporating stories from marginalized groups to challenge dominant historical or cultural narratives. Example: ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôve read this version of history, let‚Äôs take a moment to consider the stories of those whose voices weren‚Äôt heard in the mainstream narrative. What might we have missed?‚Äù

Active Listening: Peers or teachers responding positively to student stories, showing engagement and respect. Example: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a powerful story. What can we all learn from your experience? I think it gives us a new perspective on how we can approach this topic.‚Äù

**Strategy to Try** 

Narrative Leadership Model

Objective: Position storytelling as a core leadership tool for students to share experiences and ideas.

How to implement:  
1\. Establish a rotating ‚ÄúStudent Spotlight‚Äù where each learner presents a story or insight during class, connecting it to the current curriculum.  
2\. Integrate digital storytelling tools to allow students to create multimedia presentations of their narratives, encouraging creativity and innovation.  
3\. Use storytelling to teach academic content, such as asking students to create historical narratives or share fictional accounts to demonstrate mastery of key concepts.

Outcome: Enhances critical thinking and communication skills while validating student voices as central to classroom learning.

**Activity to Try**

Story Circle Time

How it works: Organize a story-sharing session where students can bring a personal narrative, a family anecdote, or a fictional tale they create. Set a theme (e.g., ‚Äúa time I was brave‚Äù or ‚Äúa family tradition‚Äù) and let each student have a moment to share.

Why it works: Builds confidence, connection, and communication skills while allowing diverse voices and experiences to be heard.
